    "\n",
    "Last time we discussed Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations in general terms. If there are only a small number of configurations to consider, then this is straightforward. But what if the system is more complicated? \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we'll consider writing down a set of MCMC rules for the 2D Ising model. A small (say, $10\\times10$) grid of spins already has many more configurations than are feasible to iterate over. \n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we considered transition probabilities $T_{ij}$ between configurations labeled $i$ and $j$. The key relationship that the $T_{ij}$ need to satisfy is [detailed balance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detailed_balance)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(i)T_{ij} = P(j)T_{ji}\\,,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P(i)$ is the probability of configuration $i$. Our first step toward practically implementing the MCMC simulation is to note that detailed balance is satisfied for a pair of configurations when $T_{ij}=T_{ji}=0$. In other words, not all transition probabilities need to be nonzero! However, we clearly can't set all of the $T_{ij}$ to zero. At the very least, we need to ensure that there is a \"path\" of nonzero transition probabilities between any two configurations of the system, so that we never get \"stuck\" on a subset of the configuration space. \n",
    "\n",
    "Practically, it's often useful to define *local* dynamics on the configuration space. For example, for the Ising model, we can set the probability for transitions between configurations that differ by one spin flip to be nonzero, and set the probability of all other transitions that involve multiple spin flips to be zero. This is useful because configurations that are very similar are likely to also have similar energies, so our transitions are unlikely to be rejected. Some advanced simulation algorithms do allow for more extensive changes in configurations, but we will not cover these during the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the examples below, we'll use the [Metropolis rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis%E2%80%93Hastings_algorithm) to set the transition probabilities for single spin flips,\n",
